# Sand-n-Stones
A datapack for minecraft that adds sand as a Husk drop, adds Husk spawning to Desert Temples, and adds crafting recipies for netherrack and red sand.

To install, drag the SandNStonesServiceDatapack_V1.0.zip into the datapacks folder of the minecraft world you want to install it in. If the world is already running, you will need to /reload, otherwise just boot up the world and it should start working by itself

To toggle debug display visiblility for troubleshooting, type /function sand_spawning:toggle_debug
To toggle temple scanning around yourself (on by default), type /function sand_spawning:toggle_scanning
